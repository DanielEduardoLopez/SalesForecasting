### **1. Introduction**
Walmart of Mexico (or WALMEX) is one of the most important retail companies within the region, with 3,903 stores in Mexico and Central America, an equity of 199,086,037 MXN, and a yearly revenue of 880,121,761 MXN, according to the figures from December 2023. According to WALMEX last financial report, its goal is to double its sales in a period of 10 years [(Wal-Mart de México S.A.B. de C.V., 2024)](#walmex).

Time series are "a set of data points ordered in time" [(Peixeiro, 2022)](#peixeiro), which can be analyzed to calculate forecasts and get valuable insights [(Kulkarni, Shivananda, Kulkarni, & Krishnan, 2023)](#kulkarni).

Univariate time series is the most used approach when analyzing time series [(Kulkarni, Shivananda, Kulkarni, & Krishnan, 2023)](#kulkarni), by means of models such as Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), or Simple Exponential Smoothing; which solely depend on the time and the variable under study.

On the other hand, it is also possible to forecast time series using regression-based modeling, in which other variables or features are used to predict the response variable [(Kulkarni, Shivananda, Kulkarni, & Krishnan, 2023)](#kulkarni). This approach could have the advantage of quantifying the impact of the external economic indicators in the performance of an organization.

In the case of Mexico, it is possible to collect public data from different government offices such as INEGI or BANXICO, or from international sources such as the S&P500, and to assess how they correlate to revenue.

In this context, it is desirable to explore both approaches to predict WALMEX net sales over the next years. Thus, the purpose of the present project is to forecast WALMEX net sales and, then, use that information to predict whether WALMEX will be able to achieve its long-term goal of doubling its sales within the next ten years.
